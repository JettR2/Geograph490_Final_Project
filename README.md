### Kinematic Analysis of Landslide Movement ü™®

### Members
Jett R and Jamel M

### Summary
This Final Project aims to utilize the tools we learned in this class to begin our project. This project aims to study and characterize a large landslide that occured in 2017, and can be found just south of Florence Oregon.

### Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
Our goal is to characterize the movement of the landslide, affect on sediment flux and watershed hydrology. Was this a rockfall, translation, rotation etc.
Based off this evidence, and historical weather data, can we piece together the cause of this landslide? Now, with this mass in a new position, is it at
equilibrium, or are fast geomorphic processes still affecting this slope?

### Datasets you will use (with links, if available)
Digital Elevation Models:
LiDAR Survey 2022
https://portal.opentopography.org/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.022023.6339.1
DOGAMI Survey 2007-2010
https://portal.opentopography.org/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.022011.2994.1

### Python packages that team members require
Rasterio , Pandas , Geopandas

### Planned methods/approach
We want to use raster tools to calculate the changes in topography due to the landslide, hillslope hydrology and profile tools to characterize movement and lasting affects. Cross referencing papers on deep-seated landslides, rotational landslides etc. will allow us to make accrurate theses on the mechanisms of failure and movement.

### Expected outcomes
We should hope to understand what kind of landslide occured, how far it moved, and why, is it in equilibrium/static now?
