# Geograph490_Final_Project

### Kinematic Analysis of Landslide Movement

### Members
Jett R and Jamel M

### Summary
This Final Projects aims to utilize the tools we have learned in this class to begin our own project. This project aims to study and characterize a large landslide that occured in 2017, and can be found just south of Florence Oregon.

### Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s)
Our goal is to characterize the movement of the landslide, affect on sediment flux and watershed hydrology. Was this a rockfall, translation, rotation etc.
Based off this evidence, and historical weather data, can we piece together the cause of this landslide?

### Datasets you will use (with links, if available)
Digital Elevation Models:
LiDAR Survey 2022
https://portal.opentopography.org/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.022023.6339.1
DOGAMI Survey 2007-2010
https://portal.opentopography.org/datasetMetadata?otCollectionID=OT.022011.2994.1

### Python packages that team members require
Rasterio
Pandas

### Planned methods/approach
We want to use raster tools to calculate the changes in topography due to the landslide, hillslope hydrology and profile tools to characterize movement and lasting affects. Cross referencing papers on deep-seated landslides, rotational landslides etc. will allow us to make accrurate theses on the mechanisms of failure and movement.

### Expected outcomes
We should expect to have a good idea of what kind of landslide occured, why it initiated, moved, and stopped. 

### Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
